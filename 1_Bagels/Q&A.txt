3)What happens if you set NUM_DIGITS to a number larger than 10 ?
A:Error: IndexError: list index out of range -> list of digits has 10 digits

4)What happens if you replace secretNum = getSecretNum() on line 30 with secretNum = '123' ?
A:Program works as expected with hardcoded secretNum value set for '123'

5)What error message do you get if you delete or comment out numGuesses = 1 ?
A:UnboundLocalError: local variable 'numGuesses' referenced before assignment
