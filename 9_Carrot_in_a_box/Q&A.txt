1)What would happen if p1Name[:11] and p2Name[:11] would be longer than 11 characters?
A:Names will be cut to maximum 11 characters.

2)What would happen if you omit the space at the end of firstBox = "Red " (line 108)?
A:Nothing really happens (maybe a slight movement of boxes ASCII).

3)What would happen if you delete or comment out print("\n" * 100) (line 85)?
A:There will be no spaces printed, hence no screen "refresh".

4)What would happen if you delete or comment out the "else:" and "break" (lines 105/106) ?
A:Then line "print(p2Name + ", please enter 'YES' or 'NO'.")" would wait forever for
the answer YES or NO.
