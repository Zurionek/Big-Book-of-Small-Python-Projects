1)How can you make the player start with a difference amount of money?
A:Change variable purse and assign it different amount.

A:By this chunk of code:
if purse == 0:
   print("You have run out of money")
   print("Thanks for playing!")
   sys.exit()

3)How does the program know if the sum of the two dice is even or odd?
A:By dividing the sum of two dice by 2 -> (sum_of_dice % 2 - if == 0 then even otherwise odd)

4)What happens if you change random.randint(1, 6) to random.randint(1, 1)?
A:The chosen number will be always 1

5)Does the house still collect a 10% fee if you change pot // 10 to 0?
A:No, if it would be 0, then house will collect nothing

6)What happens if you delete or comment out part of code:
if purse == 0:
   print("You have run out of money")
   print("Thanks for playing!")
   sys.exit()
A: We can then play without any limits as we can bet having -X money on out account infinitely.
